# UI Component Library

Welcome to the Monorepo UI Component Library! This Storybook showcases all the reusable components built with React, TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

These components are designed to be used across multiple applications in the monorepo. To use them in your application:

```bash
# Install the UI package
pnpm add @monorepo/ui

# Import components
import { Button, Card, Input } from '@monorepo/ui';
```

## Available Components

- **Button** - Interactive button with multiple variants and sizes
- **Card** - Flexible container component with customizable shadows and padding
- **Input** - Form input with label, error states, and validation support

## Design Principles

1. **Consistency** - All components follow a unified design system
2. **Flexibility** - Components are highly customizable through props
3. **Accessibility** - Built with accessibility in mind
4. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
